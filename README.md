# GIFLANDIA

### Created by: Christine Macias

## Project Overview
GIFLANDIA is a GIF search engine powered by the Giphy API. Users can enter keywords to search for GIFs, browse results in a responsive grid, and favorite GIFs during their session. The goal of this project is to practice working with JavaScript, APIs, and responsive web design while building a fun and interactive application.

## User Stories

 As a user, I want to enter a keyword into a search bar so that I can find GIFs that match what I'm looking for.  
- **User Story 2**: 
As a user, I want to see the search results displayed in a neat grid layout so that I can easily browse multiple GIFs at once.  
- **User Story 3**: 
As a user, I want to be able to "favorite" or "save" GIFs I like so that I can view them again later during my session.  
- **User Story 4**: 
As a user on a mobile device, I want the layout to adjust so that I can comfortably use the search feature and view GIFs on my phone.
